# OmniDocX — Source Collection

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

[OmniDoc](https://omnidoc.top/) · [GitHub](https://github.com/OmniDocX)

**Pinned source snapshots for OmniDoc's China-developed office projects.**

OmniDocX brings together buildable copies of UniPPT, UniCell and vecmeta for local presentation, spreadsheet and vector conversion workflows. These are independently developed OmniDoc projects; third-party dependencies retain their own origins and licenses.

## Project positioning

**Microsoft 365 (Office 365) and WPS Office** are the reference office products. Our ambition is to build the most complete China-developed office platform with publicly available source and reproducible engineering evidence. This is a development objective; see the [product comparison](docs/COMPARISON.md) for current scope and evidence. First-party code uses a non-commercial source license, detailed below.

## Performance

<!-- BENCHMARK:START -->
Environment: Windows 10 10.0.19045, Intel Core i7-1165G7 (4 cores / 8 threads), 31.70 GiB RAM, Python 3.13.11; components use Rust 1.97.1 release builds. Each case has two warmups and seven measured iterations, run sequentially. Nearest-rank P95 equals the maximum with seven samples. All measured observations are retained.

| Project | Operation | Size | Median ms | P95 ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| UniPPT | PPTX export | 100 slides | 139.41 | 316.91 |
| UniPPT | PPTX import, cache miss | 100 slides | 813.36 | 1721.34 |
| UniCell | CSV import + calculation | 10,000 rows | 660.92 | 707.79 |
| UniCell | XLSX export | 10,000 rows | 562.30 | 618.65 |
| UniCell | Batch edit + recalculation | 10,000 rows | 120.68 | 135.50 |
| vecmeta | SVG → EMF, CLI | 10,000 primitives | 105.80 | 118.47 |
| vecmeta | EMF → SVG, CLI | 10,000 primitives | 57.10 | 95.53 |

UniCell includes the SUM optimization: public-edition import plus calculation of the same 10,000-row CSV improved from 20.217 s to 0.661 s, approximately 31×; all 20,000 formulas and results passed on every new iteration. The earlier full-application experiment at 0.368 s (approximately 55×) and the old baseline are retained in the [UniCell report](projects/unicell/benchmarks/README.md). The optimized measurements use different builds and must not be conflated.

[Full report and source integrity verification](benchmarks/README.md)

Background load on the shared workstation was not fully controlled; results apply only to the listed synthetic workloads. HTTP measurements exclude browser rendering; vecmeta includes CLI startup and file I/O. Office 365, Excel and WPS were not timed, so no competitor speed ranking is reported.

## Included projects

| Project | Purpose | Source and documentation | Performance report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UniPPT | Local presentation editing and PPTX conversion | [English](projects/UniPPT/README.md) · [中文](projects/UniPPT/README.zh-CN.md) | [Benchmark](projects/UniPPT/benchmarks/README.md) |
| UniCell | Local spreadsheets, calculation and format conversion | [English](projects/unicell/README.md) · [中文](projects/unicell/README.zh-CN.md) | [Benchmark](projects/unicell/benchmarks/README.md) |
| vecmeta | SVG/EMF conversion libraries and CLI | [English](projects/vecmeta/README.md) · [中文](projects/vecmeta/README.zh-CN.md) | [Benchmark](projects/vecmeta/benchmarks/README.md) |

PolyglotPDF is excluded. The `projects/` directories contain ordinary copied files. Build each component independently and update the provenance manifest when refreshing snapshots.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OmniDocX/omnidocx.git
cd omnidocx
python tools/verify_copies.py
cd projects/UniPPT
cargo run --release --locked -p unippt-server
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8141. Consult UniCell's own documentation for its launch command and optional dependencies. This collection does not provide a combined office-suite server.

## Provenance and integrity

[sources.lock.json](sources.lock.json) records public source repositories, commit IDs and a SHA-256 for every copied file. `python tools/verify_copies.py` checks the tracked file set and file contents. Each project retains its license, third-party notices and raw benchmark observations.

The public applications use local files and loopback services. R2, cloud storage, collaborative editing, shared links and centralized accounts are outside the public edition.
